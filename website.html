<h1>Top greatest movies of all time according to Mike</h1>
<h3>My top 10 movies no specific order</h3>

<hr />
<h2>10</h2>

<h2>Forest Gump 10/10</h2>
<p> film where we watch the life story of a character is some of my
    favorite peaces of any story telling, we see him grow become smarter and go
    through hardship see his whole life, touched my heart in such a way, i love this movie so much made me ugly cry</p>
<h2>9</h2>
<h2>Green Mile 10/10</h2>
<p>  Another great story made me ugly cry just like forest gump,a movie that literally
    rotates from like the same 5 set pieces, tackles the justice system where we
    see a innocent man, blessed with godly powers curse good people(Summerizing
    it) makes us feel attached to some character that done some nasty shit, and makes us feel good for killing them, but the final death of buba was a punch to the guts omg </p>
<h2>8</h2>
<h2>Drive 10/10</h2>
<p>Badass action movie made me fall inlove with the actor of ryan gosling, gave
    birth to me saying literally me all the time badass action scenes, video game type movie.</p>
<h2>7</h2>

<h2>Princess mononoke 10/10</h2>
<p>Amazing story made by one of the greatest directors of all time who says hes
    gonna retire after every film because he thinks every film can be his last, he
    will retire come back get a grammy then disapear again, great animation beautiful artstyle and story, great relationships between characters, talk about the idea of protecting our land and the idea of technology taking over and the danger of weapons and the importance of keeping our habitats safe.</p>
<h2>6</h2>
<h2>Life of pi 10/10</h2>
<p> One of the most unique movies ive seen, tackles religion and beliefs in a
    unique way, also adventure, something ima never forget, and im not the most
    religious person. the movie taking place in the ocean, and the final message which do you prefer the story of god or the story without of god, and ofcourse we prefer the story with god cause its cooler :D</p>
<hr />
<h2>5</h2>
<h2>Twilight saga 10/10</h2>
<p>This is more like a guilty pleasure, this was such a fun watch party and
    defintely one of the most memorables ones of all time, the drama between the
    characters was so fun and dramatic, ima give this one to all the highschool
    teens with this kinda fantasy, jacob is probably the most disrespected character ive ever seen, super fun cast</p>
<h2>4</h2>
<h2>No country for old men 10/10</h2>
<p>This movie was amazing, tackling horror without the sense of your normal ghost
    and shit, this more modern western, cops and robbers type film was amazing,
    anton is such an amazing character and did such an amazing job tackling your human
    monster trope, defintely gotta watch more of his films</p>
<h2>3</h2>
<h2>Redline 10/10</h2>
<p>
  Fun movie animation, quality, so much fun gave birth to a huge animation
  studio rn, characters story made its own world revovled around cars big fun,
  the characters relationships were super cute and fun,
</p>

<h2>2</h2>
<h2>Wall-e 10/10</h2>
<p>
  Need i say more, this movie aged super well tackling the idea of us becoming
  lazy bums fat and with no legs, is a such a scary concept especially for
  somebody like me who used to be morbily obesed and its also super cute!
</p>

<h2>1</h2>
<h2>The thing 10/10</h2>
<p>
  Awesome metal asf horror movie, the idea that anybody can be the monster is
  such a dope concept and i love it
